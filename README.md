===================
IMPORTANT: The use of Parallax-img-scroll is free for both personal and commmercial use.

To use Parallax-img-scroll you only need to download the javascript file "parallaxImg.js" and add it to your <head>. 
Make sure to previously include the JQuery script, and to get a better behaviour of your scroll I recommend also adding
"jquery.nicescroll.min.js" (more info: http://nicescroll.areaaperta.com/).
